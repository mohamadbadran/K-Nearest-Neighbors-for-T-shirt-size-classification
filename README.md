# K-Nearest-Neighbors-for-T-shirt-size-classification

# PROBLEM STATEMENT :
You own an online clothing business and you would like to develop a new app (or in-store) feature in which customers would enter their own height and weight and the system would predict what T-shirt size should they wear. Features are height and weight and output is either L (Large) or S (Small).
This is a simple code to see how K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm works , in this code we are trying to predict the T-shirt size of a person who will insert his height and weight and we will predict which is the best T-shirt size for him

We will walk through these steps :

1 - Import the libraries

2 - Import the dataset

3 - Creat testing and training dataset

4 - Encoding the categorical data

5 - Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set 

6 - Model training

7 - Model testing

8 - Testing results visualization
